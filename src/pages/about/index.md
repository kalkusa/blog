Since 2013 I work as a software engineer for various companies, including big, international corporations. These few years of software industry experience brought me to the point where I find it valuable to note some of reflections about a process of creating a software.

Writing is always helpful to structure our thoughts. I hope it will bring me clarity and give the reader valuable insights about software engineering.
