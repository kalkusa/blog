Ideas list:

- Code review doesn’t guarantee code quality [ lack of big picture, architecture will create mess with clean code on small level; also – people tend to like those who accept not comment; also – people comment easiest things, are lazy and don’t analyze really complex things during review ]
- The best job interview in software industry [ automated questions etc. ]
- Agile hype [ even projects with constant, well defined scope are managed using agile methods; everyone claims they work in agile while they don’t ]
- Empathy – crucial skill for software engineer [ if software engineer can’t imagine the perspective of the other person then he can’t create clean code, can’t understand client, can’t even write proper task descriptions ]
- Unit tests are too expensive [ unit tests are too brittle, easy to break, they take too much time to maintain and discourage refactoring; only end to end tests make sense – they define business requirements and don’t care about implementation details ]
- Personality over experience [ experienced software engineers may be still very poor ones, however people who like order, who are tidy at work can be better even when rather inexperienced ]
